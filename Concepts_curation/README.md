This folder contains all codes used to create concepts' table on the database and to provide some insight. <br>
The MELD-B clinical domain expert group proposed an initial set of concepts based on long-term conditions agreed by the NIHR AIM Research Consortia, existing literature and project requirements, see [52](https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/documents/3-21), [53](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579043/),
[54](https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000247), [55](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8901063/), [56](https://github.com/THINKINGGroup/phenotypes). <br>
The initial set of concepts proposed by the group consists of  84 long-term conditions, and the full list can be found in [concept_list](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/blob/main/Concepts_curation/Concepts_codes/concepts_list.xlsx), and the full list of codes associated to each concept is available in [Concept_codes/ICD10](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/tree/main/Concepts_curation/Concepts_codes/ICD10) and [Concept_codes/ReadV2](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/tree/main/Concepts_curation/Concepts_codes/ReadV2)

Brief overview of the codes:
- [a0.a.CONC_tables_built](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/blob/main/Concepts_curation/a0.a.CONC_tables_built.ipynb): this code is used to transform the .csvs imported into SAIL into tables on the database. Each .csv is checked against the UKHDV view available in SAIL so that _only_ readV2 and ICD10 codes available in the UKHDV list are imported.
- [b1.a.SMC_CONC_outcomes_extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/blob/main/Concepts_curation/b1.a.SMC_CONC_outcomes_extraction.ipynb): this code creates outcomes tables for the SMC. For each concept, it creates a table on the database containing _all_ the records related to that concept for each individual in the cohort.
- [b2.a.SMC_CONC_outcomes_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/blob/main/Concepts_curation/b2.a.SMC_CONC_outcomes_analysis.ipynb): this code extracts an initial descriptive analysis.
