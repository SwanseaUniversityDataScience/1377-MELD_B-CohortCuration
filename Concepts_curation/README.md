The MELD-B clinical domain expert group proposed an initial set of concepts based on long-term conditions agreed by the NIHR AIM Research Consortia, existing literature and project requirements, see [52](https://openresearch.nihr.ac.uk/documents/3-21), [53](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579043/),

The initial set of concepts proposed by the group consists of  84 long-term conditions, and the full list can be found in [concept_list](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/blob/main/Concepts_curation/Concepts_codes/concepts_list.xlsx), and the full list of codes associated to each concept is available in [Concept_codes/ICD10](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/tree/main/Concepts_curation/Concepts_codes/ICD10) and [Concept_codes/ReadV2](https://github.com/SwanseaUniversityDataScience/1377-MELD_B-CohortCuration/tree/main/Concepts_curation/Concepts_codes/ReadV2)
