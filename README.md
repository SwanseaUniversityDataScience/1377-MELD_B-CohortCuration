## 📄 Project Description
This study establishes the SAIL MELD-B cohort (SMC), created with the aim of supporting the MELD-B project in developing a deeper understanding of the lived experience of the ‘burdensomness’ and ‘complexity’ of multimorbidity. 
Furthermore, it describes in detail the methodology and pipeline adopted to process all requested, reviewed and approved burden and complexity indicators that will be adopted, curated and maintained as MELD-B concepts.
