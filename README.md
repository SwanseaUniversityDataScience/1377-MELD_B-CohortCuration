## 📄 Project Description
This study establishes the SAIL MELD-B cohort (SMC) and the SAIL MELD-B Young adults e-cohort (SMYC), created with the aim to enhance the understanding of ‘burdensomeness’ in individuals living with multimorbidity, including identifying new clusters of burdensome indicators, exploring early life risk factors and modelling potential preventative scenarios.
The SMC and SMYC cohorts have been developed using a reproducible, maintainable methodological pipeline, which allows for the cohorts to be updated dynamically over time as more data coverage becomes available and manages for the request and processing of further approved concepts extraction as they are identified for use by the MELD-B group
