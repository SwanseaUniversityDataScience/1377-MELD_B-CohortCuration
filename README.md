## üìÑ Project Description
We have established the SAIL MELD-B electronic cohort (e-cohort SMC) and the SAIL MELD-B children and Young adults e-cohort (SMYC) as a part of the Multidisciplinary Ecosystem to study Lifecourse Determinants and Prevention of Early-onset Burdensome Multimorbidity (MELD-B) project. Each cohort has been created to investigate and develop a deeper understanding of the lived experience of the ‚Äòburdensomeness‚Äô of multimorbidity by identifying new clusters of burdensomness indicators, exploring early life risk factors of multimorbidity and modelling hypothetical prevention scenarios.
